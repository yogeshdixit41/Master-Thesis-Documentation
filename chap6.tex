\chapter{Conclusion}

With the increasing volume and complexity of code involved in different software systems, reliability and robustness have become important aspects of the software development industry. Use of DbC methodology in software development can help in developing such reliable software systems. 
\paragraph{}
The library designed as a part of this project allows developers to write contracts for their Java programs. Although it adds few overheads to the overall execution time, side-effects of using contracts of increased execution time can be reduced using some simple strategies discussed in Chapter \ref{performance}.
\paragraph{}
In the future work scope for this library, it can be extended to support invariants along with preconditions and postconditions in the contract definition. Support for, accessing old value of instance variables also needs to be added in the library. This will help developers write more accurate and efficient contracts for their Java methods.
